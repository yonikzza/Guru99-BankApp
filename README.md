# Guru99-BankApp
The Guru99 Bank app aims to provide its customers with a banking service.
As part of the project, I tested features such as:
- Login
- Registration
- New Customer
- Edit Customer
- Delete Customer
- New Account
- Edit Account
- Delete Account
-  Giving the fact that Guru99 Bank App is a demo app and not well configured, I was limited with my test cases but still tried to prioritaze and create the most optimized ones
- I managed to complete all the planned tests
- During testing, there were no difficulties or problems with the test environment
- The time of entire project was carried out for 2 days, an average of 4 hours per day
