Giving the fact that Guru99 Bank App is a demo app and not well configured
I was limited with my test cases but still tried to prioritaze and create the most optimized ones.

I managed to complete all the planned tests
 During testing, there were no difficulties or problems with the test environment

   The time of entire project was carried out for 2 days, an average of 4 hours per day
